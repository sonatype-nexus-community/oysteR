```

Create purls from the filtered sands of your dependencies, powered by [OSS Index](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/)

## Usage

The package has two main functions. The first, function extracts
your installed R packages and uses the Sonatype OSS Index API to scan for 
vulnerabilities

```{r, eval = FALSE} 
library("oysteR")
audit = audit_deps()
```
To extract the vulnerabilities into a nice data frame, use
```{r, eval = FALSE}
get_vulnerabilities(audit)
```

For a more in-depth discussion about how to use this package, check out [this detailed walkthrough](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/r-package-vulnerabilities-security/) by Colin Gillespie, one of the co-authors of `{oysteR}`.

### Authentication

Heavy use against OSS Index will likely run you into rate limiting (yikes!), but you can:

- Register for an account on [OSS Index](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/)
- Retrieve your API token after registering (on the User Settings page)

Set the following environment variables in your `.Renviron` file:

  - `OSSINDEX_USER` (this is set to your email address)
  - `OSSINDEX_TOKEN` (this is set to your API token)

These will be used by `{oysteR}` to authenticate with OSS Index, bumping up the amount of requests you can make.

### Tests

Our tests are in:

- `tests/testthat`

You can run tests in R like so:

`devtools::test()`

### CircleCI

Any commit should be run in CircleCI, which will check that:

- Project builds
- CRAN Check (`R CMD check`) runs

Successful builds on CircleCI are generally good, make sure to check for WARNINGS or NOTES from `R CMD check`, however!

## Contributing

We care a lot about making the world a safer place, and that's why we continue to work on this and other plugins for Sonatype OSS Index. If you as well want to speed up the pace of software development by working on this project, jump on in! Before you start work, create a new issue, or comment on an existing issue, to let others know you are!

## Reporting Missing Vulnerabilities

OSS Index contains data from public advisories. We do our best to keep it up to date, but from time to time things may slip through the cracks. If you notice some missing or incorrect data, please let us know! To report missing or incorrect vulnerabilities in OSS Index data, create an issue in the [vulnerability reporting project](https://github.com/OSSIndex/vulns).

## The Fine Print

It is worth noting that this is **NOT SUPPORTED** by Sonatype, and is a contribution of ours
to the open source community (read: you!)

Remember:

- Use this contribution at the risk tolerance that you have
- Do NOT file Sonatype support tickets related to `{oysteR}`
- DO file issues here on GitHub, so that the community can pitch in

Phew, that was easier than I thought. Last but not least of all:

Have fun creating and using this extension and [Sonatype OSS Index](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/), we are glad to have you here!

## Getting help

The best way to get in touch is to join us on the [oysteR Gitter](https://gitter.im/sonatype-nexus-community/oysteR) - see you there!
