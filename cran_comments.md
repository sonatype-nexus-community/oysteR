`installed.packages()` is core to this package's functionality - check the users
installed packages for vulnerabilities. We do __not__ use this to
 * find out if a named package is installed, or
 * find out if a package is usable, or
 * find details of a small number of packages

We use this function to obtain a list of all packages currently installed in order to check
them for known vulnerabilities. When the function is called, we provide a message to the user
stating this may take a while
